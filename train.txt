Divergences:

- type of estimator
- how to obtain samples of the parameters
    - sample from prior
    - sample from posterior
    - importance sampling estimators...
- reuse of parameters
- electric field calculation
- batch size
- batch v sequential
- noise model

4th run assumptions
- look into numerical issues

Other estimators
- Gaussian approx + linearized model -> analytical solution
- layered multiple importance sampling
