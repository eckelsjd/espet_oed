Divergences:

- type of estimator
- how to obtain samples of the parameters
    - sample from prior
    - sample from posterior
    - importance sampling estimators...
- reuse of model parameters
    - use same set of theta between inner loops
    - use same set of theta between operating conditions
- reuse of nuisance parameters
- electric field calculation
- batch size
- batch v sequential
- noise model

1st run assumptions
- gaussian noise model
- 1 operating condition, 1 output
- use same set of thetas from Collin's posterior for inner/outer
- previous sim results for electric field
- same set of nuisance params for all marginalizations

2nd run assumptions
- run on gpu
- works without nuisance params
- can resample nuisance params for each theta

3rd run assumptions
- can resample theta and eta for inner loop

4th run assumptions
- can detect memory overflow and switch to memory mapped mode
- uncertainty in operating conditions (nuisance param is additive noise)
