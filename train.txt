Divergences:

- type of estimator
- how to obtain samples of the parameters
    - sample from prior
    - sample from posterior
    - importance sampling estimators...
- reuse of parameters
- electric field calculation
- batch size
- batch v sequential
- noise model

4th run assumptions
- look into numerical issues

Other estimators
- Gaussian approx + linearized model -> analytical solution
- layered multiple importance sampling

Limitations/surrogate:
- formulation of 4039 nuisance parameters, should just have noise variance as nuisance, and the model should be stochastic
- can't do this because the electrostatic model takes too long
- refactor of r_pr, and E(s) distribution -- basically cite the better model and need for better E(s) surrogate
- causes numerical issues with jacobian and linearization, need to do marginalization over p(phi|y) and assume phi independent of data
- refactor likelihood model because of dependence of experimental noise on voltage
- consider sequential design
- consider design of geometries for calibrating the parameters
