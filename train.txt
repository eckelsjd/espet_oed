Divergences:

- type of estimator
- how to obtain samples of the parameters
    - sample from prior
    - sample from posterior
    - importance sampling estimators...
- reuse of parameters
- electric field calculation
- batch size
- batch v sequential
- noise model


4th run assumptions
- accept batch size as argument
- detect memory allocation and break to give warning
- look into numerical issues
- uncertainty in operating conditions (nuisance param is additive noise)
